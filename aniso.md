# Abstract

Brushed finishes are widely used in architecture, large and small appliances, etc. ANISO aims to develop new digital and manufacturing technologies to produce customized and innovative anisotropic surface finishes. The aim is to go beyond unidirectional and circular surface finishes by allowing the designer to choose the brushing orientation for all surface positions. This freedom makes it possible to design customized and complex anisotropic appearances. Fabricating anisotropic appearances on 3D surfaces with arbitrary, spatially varying, high-definition orientations remains an open problem. We target glossy materials: metals (e.g., aluminum, silver, and gold), plastics (e.g., PETG and PLA), and glass. ANISO's key idea is to use manufacturing processes that directly produce anisotropic surface roughness: Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and surface brushing. We plan to develop an algorithm that generates orientable, space-filling trajectories to control the direction of anisotropy at each point. Open-source software will be developed to interactively design and visualize anisotropic appearances with spatially variable directions to democratize the manufacture of this type of appearance. ANISO will enable Industry 4.0 to customize surface finishes and make them unique. Customization will be achieved using a single material that does not require paint or chemicals, making recycling easier. In addition, the surface finish of injection molding could be impacted by ANISO, enabling Industry 4.0 to produce customized parts and unique visuals on a large scale.
