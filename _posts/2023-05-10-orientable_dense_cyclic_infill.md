Our article **Orientable Dense Cyclic Infill for Anisotropic Appearance Fabrication** (with [Cédric Zanni](https://members.loria.fr/CZanni/), [Jonàs Martínez](https://sites.google.com/site/jonasmartinezbayona/), Pierre-Alexandre Hugron, and [Sylvain Lefebvre](https://www.antexel.com/sylefeb/research)) got accepted to SIGGRAPH 2023.

We propose to create 3D-printed flat surfaces with controlled, spatially varying, anisotropic appearances similar to brushed metal using standard fused filament fabrication printers. We achieved high-quality visual results using a novel, robust, efficient, oriented cycle generator. We empirically show that the deposition and roughness anisotropy directions are the same.
