Thrilled to announce that our innovative toolpath generator, [Atomizer](https://xavierchermain.github.io/publications/atomizer), received an honorable mention at [SGP](https://sgp2025.my.canva.site/)! Atomizer is a new method for fused filament fabrication (3D printing) that offers a novel approach to generating toolpaths, moving beyond traditional non-planar slicing.

To celebrate this achievement and make this technology more accessible, I'm sharing my presentation on YouTube. In the video, I introduce Atomizer and discuss its advantages over current slicing methods. You'll learn about:

- The limitations of planar and non-planar slicers.
- The core concepts of Atomizer, including uniform "atom" distribution for consistent spacing.
- The implementation of Atomizer in Python and the results of our experiments.

I hope this presentation will be insightful for the #3Dprinting community!
