*Towards Accessible Non-Planar FFF Using Triple Z-Axis Kinematics*

I'm excited to share that our latest research will be presented this Friday at the ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication (SCF '25), hosted at MIT - by [Giovanni Cocco](https://github.com/iota97) and [Vincent Belle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-belle/).

In this work, we explore how to make non-planar fused filament fabrication (FFF) truly accessible by upgrading standard 3D printers with minimal, low-cost modifications.

🔧 **What we propose:**

By extending the rails and bed screws of triple Z-axis printers-such as the [RatRig](https://ratrig.com/) V-Core-we enable up to 30° of bed tilt, unlocking true non-planar 5-DOF printing without the need for robotic arms.
We also introduce a complete closed-form kinematic model and an open-source Python implementation for mapping curved toolpaths to machine space.

✨ **Key highlights:**

- Closed-form forward & inverse kinematics for 3-Z machines
- Open-source implementation for toolpath conversion
- Minimal hardware modification enabling curved-layer printing
- Build volume, tolerance, and interpolation analysis
- Successful fabrication of complex non-planar models

This work lowers the barrier to experimenting with advanced additive manufacturing techniques.
