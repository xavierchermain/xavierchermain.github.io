I am a researcher at [Inria Nancy](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-nancy-grand-est), in the [MFX team](https://mfx.loria.fr/) since December 2022. My research focuses on Computer Graphics and, more precisely, on physically based rendering, BRDFs, specular microstructures, additive manufacturing, and appearance fabrication.
